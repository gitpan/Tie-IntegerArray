NAME

Tie::IntegerArray - provides a tied array of packed integers of any bit length

DESCRIPTION

This module provides an array interface to packed array of integers.
A packed array of integers is useful in situations where you need to
store a large set of integers in as small a space as possible.  Access
to the packed array will be significantly slower than access to a
normal array but for many applications the reduction in memory usage
makes this a good trade-off.
